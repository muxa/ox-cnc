## Wasteboard

M5 nut inserts, spaced 150mm, stagerred so that in the centre of 150x150 square there's a nut.

The wasteboard has a 18mm MDF base which extends in front and the back of the frame, and there's an extra 18mm MDF sheet on top which is the size of the cutting area. This allows surfacing the entire cutting area without leaving any "border", which in turn allows working with workpieces which are longer than the cutting area.
